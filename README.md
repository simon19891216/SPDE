The Windows and macOS version of SPDEv3.0 have been completed. You can download it from ["Releases"](https://github.com/simon19891216/SPDE/releases/tag/database).

Additionally, the example files and sample data can also be downloaded from the same site. Furthermore, we have set up a communication community for SPDE (["QQ"](https://im.qq.com/index/) Group ID: 1036612725), where developers are present to address users' software usage issues in real time.

Meanwhile, we utilized plant models provided by the Flora of China and extend our sincere gratitude and respect to the authors who created these precise botanical illustrations. However, since the publication dates back to the 1980s, it has been challenging to establish contact with the original authors. Although SPDE is non-commercial software and these models have been reorganized and edited by us, if any original authors believe our use of these images constitutes infringement, please contact us, and we will consider removing the corresponding images from SPDE.
